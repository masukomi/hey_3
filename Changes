Revision history for Hey


## [1.0.0-beta.9] - 2023-???????
ADDED:
- hey today
  a shorthand for running "hey log 1 day". I'm finding that to be my
  most common invocation of the logs by a wide margin and figured others
  probably would to. Well, if anyone was using this other than me.


## [1.0.0-beta.8] - 2023-01-19
ADDED:
- hey summarize timers <number> <duration>
  ex. hey summarize timers 2 days
  produces a report of the total time spent on each project
  over the course of the specified duration
- hey tag <event id>
  allows you to easily tag a timer/interruption after it's been created

FIXED:
- corrected a bash unit test

CHANGED:
- Stopping an invalid timer now exits with 65 not 0

## [1.0.0-beta.7] - 2022-12-30
ADDED
- hey projects
  lists all the projects you've recorded. Useful when you
  can't remember what you called something, and for other
  tooling, like shell autocomplete. ;)

FIXED
- How we determine AM vs PM for a time that's less than 12
  I think this was a bug introduced in beta 6

CHANGED
- general refactoring.
  Modules no longer exit directly, but instead raise exceptions.
- added some raku unit tests
  Previously there were just bash_unit tests, but with help
  from the #RakuLang folks on Mastodon I managed to figure
  out how to freeze time, and then that I didn't need to.

  The result is some real testing around the backdating code
  which has been the most problematic.


## [1.0.0-beta.6] - 2022-12-18
ADDED
- hey nevermind
  deletes the most recent running timer
- duration-string method in Utilities
- timer-duration method in Timer
-
FIXED
- hey running
  It was calling an old method signature that was erroring out.
  A test has been added.

CHANGED
- hey stop
  Now has more verbose output:
  Ex. "Stopped 57 at Wed, 10:40 AM (@raku)  after 1h31m"
  I found that the extra info was very useful for confirming I'd stopped
  the right thing, when dealing with timers that had been left running for days.

## [1.0.0-beta.5] - 2022-12-17
ADDED
- Tests! Most everything has test coverage now, except for the backdating and date specification in logs. PRs welcome.
- Ability to specify sorting when retrieving events.

CHANGED
- Log output now has "concise" durations.
  Ex. "2 hours and 23 minutes" is now written as "2h23m".
  Note: that's a bit too "consice" for my liking but it's what the
  library offered.
- Table generators are no longer overriding sorting of the list passed
  in.
- MAJOR refactoring. Took most of the methods out of
  `Database.rakumod` and moved them into domain specific files.
- Now prints out nice message instead of empty table when there are no
  timers or interrupts recorded in the specified duration.
- logs now use 12hr time with AM/PM designation.

FIXED
- changed the logging to use cultural durations instead of literal.
  See README for details. tl;dr: 1 day gets you today. 1 week gets you
this week. Hours, minutes, and seconds are literal amounts.

## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2022-12-16
ADDED
- now you can kill a specific timer

FIXED
- corrected edge case with adjusting time post noon.
- corrected bug in a couple places where only the first row of a query was being returned

CHANGED
- Removed summary from all tables
  It wasn't wrapping and looked terrible.
  Will reinstate once i get the wrapping working again.
- Improved output
  - Now specifes id of newly created timer
  - Now sorts people, projects, & tags in table views
- Exit code for user error is now 64

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - 2022-12-16
- Corrected determination of a backdate being 'yesterday'
- Corrected a bad function call in adjusting time for yesterday

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2022-12-15
- Corrected bad META6.json file

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2022-12-15
- Initial Release. Fingers crossed.
